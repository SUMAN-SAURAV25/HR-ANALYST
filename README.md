In this project, we built a PowerBI model to predict employee attrition using a Random
Forest classifier. We started by loading and exploring the dataset, followed by data
preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation. Finally, we analyzed feature importances
and discussed the steps for model deployment.
This project can be further enhanced by:
● Tuning hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.
● Trying SQL commands .
● Incorporating additional features.
● Building a more sophisticated model evaluation process.
